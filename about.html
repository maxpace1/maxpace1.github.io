            <p class="mb-0">Hi, my name is Max! I'm a computer science and mathematics major at Cornell University
              interested
              in machine learning and robotics.</p>
          </div>

            <div>
              <p>At Cornell, I have been researching at <a href="https://www.portal.github.io">PoRTaL Lab</a> under
                Professor Sanjiban
                Choudhury focusing on imitation learning and visuomotor policies for a mobile manipulator robot. I am
                working toward my first publication on the necessity of proper data collection, model selection, and
                loss
                choice and recipes for how to achieve them in the context of visuomotor learning. My future interests
                lie
                in exploring how to teach robots to perform highly technical skills more efficiently and safely than
                humans.</p>
              <p>I have also been on the controls software team for <a
                  href="https://marsrover.engineering.cornell.edu">Cornell Mars Rover</a>, focusing on vision systems
                for
                mineral classification and typing on a keyboard. As part of the University Rover Challenge, the team is
                required to teleoperate the rover to type on a keyboard, which my work on key segmentation simplifies
                dramatically. The team is also required to classify rocks found in the desert, a task my mineral
                classifier helped dramatically in.</p>
              <p>Having enjoyed the intersection of math and computer science, I loved Cornell's Discrete Structures
                course (CS 2800) and have been a teaching assistant for three semesters, including serving as a Head TA
                in
                Spring, 2023. This position entailed being the primary instructor in a discussion session, holding
                weekly
                office hours, creating rubrics for weekly problem sets, and leading a grading group of 11 TAs. I also
                spent a semester as a consultant for Cornell's Functional Programming and Data Structures course (CS
                3110), helping students grasp the mentality and style of coding in OCaml.</p>
              <p>I was fortunate enough to be able to join the 2022-2023 cohort of eLab, Cornell's student accelerator
                program for providing aspiring entrepreuers with the skills, mentorship, and initial funding to turn
                ideas
                into companies. There, I focused on my startup Synopsis, a company aimed at helping business executives
                save time by finding articles relevant to their industry interests and summarizing the important
                takeaways.</p>
              <p>Outside of my work on campus, I have enjoyed working as a software engineer at Guidewire Software, a
                P&C
                insurance software company, where I got to work on minimizing costs on AWS redshift clusters. There, I
                restructured the way API calls were being made to AWS to expose more data, which I then displayed
                alongside incurred costs in a simple and informative web interface I designed.</p>
              <p>In my free time, I love baking and eating bread in Cornell's Bread Club, working toward becoming a
                scratch golfer, and solving the New York Times daily crossword.</p>
