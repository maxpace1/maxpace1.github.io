              <h4 class="h3 mb-2">Keyboard Detection</h4>
              <p>In the equipment servicing mission, the rover is tasked with operating a control panel, which includes
                the subtask of typing on a keyboard. The rover's arm is a 12 joint system, which is difficult to control
                precisely enough to efficiently operate the keyboard.</p>
              <p>I designed a program utilizing the camera on the rover's mast to identify and segment the keyboard,
                apply a homography and enhance the enhance the image for human visibility, and then allow the operator
                to click on a key in the image for the rover to maneuver to via inverse kinematics.</p>
              <p>Ensuring robustness of the keyboard segmentation and corner detection proved to be the primary
                challenge in this project.
                After experimenting with a variety of segmentation models (including testing various thresholding
                techniques and training my own models), I eventually found best success, measured as a comparison of
                accuracy and execution time, with Model Zoo's ResNet-50 RCNN. Corner detection also proved inconsistent
                without modifying the segmented image, but the program was made more robust through a combination
                blurring, adaptive thresholding, eroding, and dilating.

              <p>As part of the science mission, the rover used to look at rocks under various light filters from a
                filter wheel. The team was
                challenged to identify the rocks.</p>
              <p>This program aided the team in identifying the rocks to serve as an extra measurement of confidence
                in our prediction and help break any ties in potential candidates. I implemented the classifier using
                the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm due to the extremely small dataset we had access to. The dataset
                limited the choice of algorithm and prevented the use of more complex models. Nevertheless, I was able
                to see a much higher degree of success (by 70% in validation accuracy) than the prior attempt at an
                implementation.</p>
              <p>Sadly, the tool was never used in competition as the filter wheel was scrapped and competition
                requirements changed. Nevertheless, the reimplementation was an overall success and an exciting project
                to work on.</p>

            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>In August, 2022, my roommate Daniel and I pitched an idea for a personalized industry news report to the
              directors of eLab, a credit-bearing and funding-providing startup accelerator at Cornell. We were
              delighted to be receive an invitation to join the Fall 2022 cohort, which we hastily accepted. For a
              semester, we spent time fleshing out our idea, developing and revising a formal business model, conducting
              over 50 customer discovery interviews, and learning about the fundamentals of entrepreuership. In October,
              we gave a 2 minute pitch in Manhattan publicly introducing our idea and our progress, connecting ourselves
              with several viewers who were able to provide further advice and mentorship. Throughout the semester, our
              idea began to morph into a dashboard for on-demand queries about current trends in the industry and news
              finding for immediate email responses.</p>
            <p>In December, we were convinced of the potential of our idea, and we received another invitation to
              continue our progress in the Spring 2023 cohort. This semester provided us with siginificantly more
              mentorship and connected us with advisors who have been instrumental in our progress and idea refinement.
              Course content focused more heavily on some of the post-ideation aspects of forming a company, and we were
              provided $5,000 in funding. The program also gave us the opportunity to pitch in San Fransisco at the
              Cornell Silicon Valley event as well as at eLab's Demo Day on campus.</p>
            <p>By the end of the semester, we shifted our focus to a more immediate plan for helping executives save
              time. This involved allowing users to provide an email from investors or other important contacts asking
              about an event or trend, finding relevant news, and providing a draft response with proper sources. After
              further discussion with advisors and some talks with directors at Y Combinator, we decided to take on a
              major pivot, focusing instead on data science presentations and improving how engaging and story-like they
              can be.</p>
            <p>Our progress today continues around this idea of data science presentations, and our progress is ongoing.
              We are currently finalizing our product for deployment by end of February, 2024.</p>

            <h2>Flappy Bird AI</h2>
            <p>While studying Robot Learning in CS 4756, I worked on a reinforcement learning research project with two
              partners. We chose to build an AI for the beloved game of Flappy Bird using Q-Learning. The agent is
              trained in the FlapPyBird gym environment, where it can be queried for an action every
              frame.</p>
            <p>
              <video autoplay muted playsinline loop class="img-fluid d-block w-200"
                style="border-radius: 16px; max-width: 400px; float: right; margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <source src="assets/img/flappy_high.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
              </video>
            <p>Our first model was trained using a lookup table for each possible state-action pair updated every
              frame according to the Bellman Equation. Since the game's states are mostly continuous, we discretized the
              states enough to allow the agent to update all possible states frequently enough while also preserving
              enough information to make an informed action. At any given frame, the bird can choose to jump or continue
              its trajectory, which decides its action space.</p>
            <p>A fairly simple reward structure proved successful, where
              the bird was simply penalized at its death. Applying the punishment at the correct time was slightly more
              tricky, since some actions caused inevitable deaths several frames later that the actions in between had
              no real bearing on. As such, the penalty was applied at the frames just prior to the bird's death if it
              collided with the ground or a lower pipe since it should have jumped. In the other case of it colliding
              with an upper pipe, only the bird's final jump was penalized since it is what primarily contributed to the
              agent's demise.</p>
            <p>We found that after training for only 30,000 games, the agent was able to achieve scores over 150;
              however, training progress after this became exponentially slower, since the majority of states the bird
              encountered were ones it already was making the correct choice in, and the states it failed in were
              becoming increasingly rare. To mitigate this, we remodeled the environment to allow the bird to start
              close to where it died so as to let it learn the correct Q values in those critical states more
              efficiently. This resulted in the bird being able to reach scores well over a million. </p>
            <p>On my own, I was curious if the Q values could be learned as a continuous function without discretzation
              and utilizing a neural network instead. Upon further reading in Deep Q Networks (DQNs), I attempted to use
              an architecture employing a set of shared layers fed separately into a value function stream and advantage
              function stream, which were combined into a Q value. The model was also trained using a target network
              with weights updated less frequently than the main network.</p>
            <p>This model was not as succcessful as the Q-Table. While DQNs can be successful, it is difficult to train
              a network when the labels are not known and are being guessed by effectively the same network. I still
              suspect that with further hyperparameter tuning and architecture modifications, a DQN can be trained to
              generate actions for a succesful Flappy Bird agent.</p>
